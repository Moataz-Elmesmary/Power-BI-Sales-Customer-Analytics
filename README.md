# üìä AdventureWorks Sales Analytics (Power BI)

This repository contains a comprehensive Power BI project focused on analyzing sales performance using the AdventureWorks sample database. The dashboard provides key insights into orders, revenue, product performance, and sales territories, built on a robust data model with advanced DAX measures and interactive visualizations.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The main objective of this project was to transform raw sales data from AdventureWorks into actionable insights. This involved:
* Connecting to the SQL Server database in DirectQuery mode.
* Performing extensive data cleaning and transformation using Power Query.
* Designing a robust Star Schema data model.
* Creating a rich set of DAX measures, including advanced KPIs.
* Developing interactive and insightful dashboards with drill-down, drill-through, and tooltip capabilities.

## ‚ú® Key Features & Insights

* **Sales Trend Analysis:** Track total orders and revenue over time, comparing Order Date, Ship Date, and Due Date impacts.
* **Product Performance:** Analyze order quantity by product category, subcategory, and individual products.
* **Territory Performance:** Evaluate sales and orders by sales territory, including top performers.
* **Sales Person Performance:** Identify top sales persons based on orders or total sales amount.
* **Shipping & Order Status Analysis:** Insights into order fulfillment and shipping methods.
* **Advanced KPIs:** Monitor key metrics like Year-over-Year Sales Growth, Average Order Value, Gross Profit Margin, and Average Days to Ship.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools

* **Microsoft Power BI Desktop:** For data connection, transformation, modeling, DAX, and visualization.
* **SQL Server:** As the data source (AdventureWorks database).
* **Power Query (M Language):** For data ingestion and transformation.
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** For creating calculated columns and measures.

## üìÅ Project Structure
### 1. Data Connection & DirectQuery Mode
### 2. Data Transformation with Power Query
Extensive data cleaning, reshaping, and merging were performed in Power Query Editor to prepare the data for modeling. Key transformations included:
* **Renaming Tables and Columns:** For clarity and ease of use in the reporting layer.
* **Removing Unused Columns:** To optimize performance and reduce model size.
* **Merging Product Tables:** `Production.Product`, `Production.ProductSubcategory`, and `Production.ProductCategory` were merged into a single `Products` dimension table containing `ProductID`, `Product Name`, `SubCategory`, and `Category`.
* **Creating a Dates Table:** A dedicated date dimension table was generated using Power Query to support time-intelligence functions.
* **Adding Order Status:** A custom column for readable order status text was added based on the `ufnGetSalesOrderStatusText` logic (or a conditional column mapping).
